  Technophobia explores the intersection of technology, surveillance, and human
  identity, using AI and motion design to create an interactive experience. It
  critically examines ethical dilemmas surrounding AI, particularly
  technophobia, by blending live data and AI-generated imagery to engage viewers
  in a dynamic narrative about the evolving relationship between humans and
  machines.

My approach to this project was driven by a desire to explore the ethical implications of AI and its impact on society, particularly the fears and anxieties it provokes. By using AI tools like Stable Diffusion and integrating them with TouchDesigner, I created a series of interactive scenes that depict surveillance, technophobia, and the blurring lines between humans and machines. Each scene was meticulously crafted, drawing inspiration from various artists and technical resources, to evoke the sensation of being monitored and the growing convergence of organic and artificial life.
