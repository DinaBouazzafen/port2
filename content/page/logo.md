description: I designed three unique logos tailored for distinct purposes; a small business (Mimounia), a fashion designer (Kirakira/Blingkira), and an artist (Nosa). Each logo represents a deep exploration of brand identity, incorporating the essence and personality of the client.

The creative process behind these logos involved extensive research and close collaboration with the clients to ensure each design authentically represented their unique identity and goals. 
For Mimounia, the focus was on crafting a friendly and memorable logo that would resonate with its target audience. This involved multiple iterations to strike a balance between playfulness and professionalism, ultimately resulting in a design that embodies the approachable yet refined nature of the small business. 
Kirakira/Blingkira’s logo, on the other hand, required a glamorous and modern aesthetic to match the bold and sparkling creations of the fashion designer. Incorporating her personal tattoo into the design and using “Kirakira” written in Japanese, a key inspiration for her artistry, added a deeply personal touch that aligns with her distinctive style and creative ethos.
For Nosa, the design process emphasized playfulness and personal identity. Drawing inspiration from her fingerprint, the color blue, and stars, symbols deeply tied to her as an individual, the logo became a reflection of her artistic spirit. By weaving these elements together, the design captures her personality and creative essence in a way that feels both intimate and dynamic. 
Each logo serves as more than just a visual marker; it tells a unique story and connects deeply with its audience, embodying the ethos and aspirations of the individuals and brands they represent. Through careful attention to detail and creative exploration, these designs bring each vision to life in a way that is impactful, meaningful, and enduring.
