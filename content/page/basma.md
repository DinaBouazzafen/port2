Basma is rooted in the exploration of how an artistâ€™s personal traumas and fears can influence the viewer, aiming to create a deeper connection between art and its audience. Through extensive research on the psychological effects of trauma and the therapeutic power of artistic expression, I sought to design an installation that not only presents art but actively involves viewers in the experience. Using advanced technologies such as the Muse2 brainwave tracker and integrating Arduino with TouchDesigner, I developed artworks that respond to viewers' inputs, creating a personalized and emotionally engaging journey. This approach disrupts the traditional passive role of the viewer, transforming them into participants who interact with the art in a way that can alleviate anxiety and enhance emotional well-being. The successful outcomes from user testing highlight the potential of such interactive art installations in therapeutic settings.
