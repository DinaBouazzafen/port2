Drawing from skills in character modeling (using Maya and Mudbox), texture painting (Substance Painter and Maya), rigging, skinning, and animation assembly in Unity, I brought Hearty to life. Every aspect of Hearty’s design reflects a deeply personal connection, as they symbolize who I might be if I existed in a more idealized, animated world. The production pipeline—from sculpting and painting textures to rigging and animating—was a meticulous process aimed at conveying the emotional depth and transformation central to the story. The final rendering in Unity added dynamic lighting and textures that enhanced the visual and emotional impact."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:page:gaiety.md","_source":"content","_file":"page/gaiety.md","_stem":"page/gaiety","_extension":"md"},"hash":"zFkI0bw1D6"}
