Each visual represents a distinct fear or phobia; scopophobia (fear of being watched), agoraphobia (fear of open spaces or crowds), addiction, technophobia, thalassophobia (fear of deep water), and eco-anxiety (fear of environmental damage).","layout":"default","imagegallery":{"showgallery":false,"carouselgrid":"carousel","galleryImages":null},"thumbnail":"/img/fears.png","date":"2024-10-09T17:46:19.079Z","layoutpage":"layout1","promoted":"0","categoryTitle":"Motion","category":"motion","link":"motion","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4kx2dMw8xc?autoplay=1&loop=1&mute=1&playlist=z4kx2dMw8xc","included":true,"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"These artworks were not just conceptual pieces but deliberately crafted tools for exploring the psychological effects of art on participants. The interactive nature of these visuals was enhanced through the integration of advanced technologies such as Arduino and the Muse2 brainwave tracker, allowing real-time tracking of emotional and cognitive responses. This approach created a dynamic and personalized interaction, making the visuals an essential component of the study’s methodology.\nThe user-testing process was central to this project, aiming to measure the emotional impact of these visuals on participants before and after exposure. By focusing on shifts in emotions such as joy, anxiety, relaxation, and sadness, the research underscores how art can influence psychological states. The visuals were designed to evoke and address deep-seated fears, encouraging participants to confront and reflect on these emotions in a controlled and supportive environment. This study highlights how interactive art, specifically created for testing purposes, can foster emotional recovery and provide insights into the transformative power of art. By combining art, technology, and psychology, the project redefines the viewer’s role, turning them into active participants and demonstrating the therapeutic potential of such installations in addressing trauma and fear."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:page:fears.md","_source":"content","_file":"page/fears.md","_stem":"page/fears","_extension":"md"},"hash":"lrYfmQaRzj"}
