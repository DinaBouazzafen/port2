Inspired by my personal experiences with anxiety and the comfort my cats provide, I aimed to design a narrative that others struggling with similar challenges could relate to. The animation was crafted using layered textures, warm color palettes, and fluid transitions to visually convey the emotional journey from anxiety to healing. By integrating elements of mixed media, I sought to emphasize the depth and complexity of this relationship, making it both visually and emotionally immersive. Healing Philozoic is more than a story; itâ€™s a celebration of the simple yet profound joy that animals can bring to our lives, offering hope and a sense of peace to anyone in need."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:page:punching-love.md","_source":"content","_file":"page/punching-love.md","_stem":"page/punching-love","_extension":"md"},"hash":"VaC37cjKGR"}
