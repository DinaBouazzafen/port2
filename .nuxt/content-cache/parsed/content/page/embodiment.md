This firsthand knowledge helped shape the poster's narrative, which portrays the duality of religion—highlighting how religious history has often been misused to create division and conflict. By incorporating elements from both Jewish and Christian symbolism, I aimed to illustrate the commonalities between these faiths, focusing on the figure of Jesus, who was born and died a Jew. His story is subtly integrated into the design to challenge the perception that He belongs solely to Christianity. A phrase on the synagogue’s façade, \"Do we not all have the same Father?\" served as a crucial inspiration, reinforcing the idea that all believers, regardless of their religion, worship the same God. This poster is thus a reflection of unity and shared faith."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:page:embodiment.md","_source":"content","_file":"page/embodiment.md","_stem":"page/embodiment","_extension":"md"},"hash":"GYlzT0wBvJ"}
