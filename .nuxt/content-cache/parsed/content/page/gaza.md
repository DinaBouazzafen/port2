The inclusion of terms like “tragedy,” “propaganda,” “violence,” and “refugees” confronts the viewer with the realities of life in Gaza, while the overarching total “genocide” forces a reckoning with the ultimate outcome of such prolonged suffering. The bottom of the receipt calls for action and awareness with the message “Free Palestine, Free the People,” urging collective responsibility and empathy. By incorporating a minimal yet impactful design, the piece seeks to engage viewers emotionally and intellectually, fostering dialogue on accountability, justice, and the urgent need for humanitarian intervention. This visual representation merges art, activism, and advocacy, amplifying the voices of the silenced and emphasizing the unquantifiable cost of human suffering."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:page:gaza.md","_source":"content","_file":"page/gaza.md","_stem":"page/gaza","_extension":"md"},"hash":"FlWaAMQgj5"}
